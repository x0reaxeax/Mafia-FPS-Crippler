# Mafia-FPS-Crippler
Brings down FPS in original Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven.. in the stupidest way ever..

## Usage
Have Mafia running, run the program and press `ENTER` to spawn a new thread.  
Repeat until your FPS drops in half (usually up to the amount of your available processor threads).  
When done, type `'x'` and press `ENTER` to free the running threads.  

## Benchmark
| CPU                    | Required Threads |

|  Intel Core i7-7700K   | 7                |
